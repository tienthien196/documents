Keras

Keras is a deep learning API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras focuses on debugging speed, code elegance & conciseness, maintainability, and deployability. When you choose Keras, your codebase is smaller, more readable, easier to iterate on.

Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It was designed for rapid prototyping and ease of use, abstracting away much of the complexity of lower-level frameworks. Keras can run on top of various backends, including TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft CNTK. In TensorFlow 2.0 and later, Keras became the official high-level API within TensorFlow, accessible as tf.keras.
